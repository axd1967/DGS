(1) Take Server offline.


(2) Backup database.


(3) Backup samurajdata.

   (.) make clear and separate the /snapshot entries (with adjusted descriptions)
   for:
      - DGS-20060926.tar.gz
      - images-20060926.tar.gz
      - DGS-20070915.tar.gz
      - images-20070915.tar.gz


(4) On samurajdata:

   (.) Give JUG an access+password to the /scripts folder

   * Run the old consistency tests:
      -/scripts/message_consistency.php
      -/scripts/player_consistency.php
      (optionnaly: -/scripts/game_consistency.php (the most time consumming))
     Fix the obvious detected bugs.


(5) Update code from cvs. Update images.

   - replace/add those images from devel server to live server:
    images/send.gif,
    images/read.gif,
    images/invite.gif,
    images/edit.gif,
    images/trashcan.gif,
    images/remove.gif,
    images/sort1a.gif,
    images/sort1d.gif,
    images/sort2a.gif,
    images/sort2d.gif,
    images/forward.gif,
    images/backward.gif,
    images/end.gif,
    images/start.gif,
    images/plus.gif,
    images/minus.gif,
    images/cross.gif,

   - replace the new Lesotho flag (old one kept in ls_old.gif)
     and other adjusted flags:
    images/flags/ls.gif,
    images/flags/__.gif,
    images/flags/eu.gif,

   - (some of the wood*.* files are no more needed ?)


(6) Transfer changes to samurajdata.


(7) Update database with /scripts/updates/1.0.13/database_changes.mysql


(8) Apply changes from /scripts/updates/1.0.13/other_changes.txt

   * Run the new consistency tests:
      -/scripts/message_consistency.php
      -/scripts/player_consistency.php
      -/scripts/game_consistency.php
      -/scripts/recalculate_ratings2.php (long but needed: we have
adjusted the EGF and the win/lost calculus)

   * Regenerate new translation entries.
      - check+translate the english #short entries

   * Run the new consistency test:
      -/scripts/translation_consistency.php
      

   (.) Check if new admins flags are still correctly set
   (.) Give JUG at least the same flags as Rodival.
   (.) Enable both 3 of us as Skin+Developer (this is not yet fully effective but there are already some features)
((
Be aware that if you enable a "New admin" people (ADMIN_ADD_ADMIN flag), he
will only be able to modify his own flags of the other users (a
ADMIN_ADD_ADMIN+ADMIN_FORUM one can only grant ADMIN_FORUM people... or
disable them... including himself). Only ADMIN_ADMINS can grant ADMIN_ADD_ADMIN
people.
For instance, Bjorn could be empowered to add/remove the FAQ co-editors by
setting his flag to ADMIN_ADD_ADMIN+ADMIN_FAQ.
))
