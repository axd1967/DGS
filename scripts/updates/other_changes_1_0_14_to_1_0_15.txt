# Forum-behavior has been changed: Threads are no longer hidden if a thread
# with more than one post has only the initial thread post hidden!!
#
# That means, some threads suddenly may appear, that have been hidden before.
# In order to fix this, after all DDL-changes have been made and sources are updated,
# run the forum-consistency-script and copy all the UPDATEs. You may want to hide
# some of the now visible hidden threads.

# Run it at least twice with "Validation it"-step.
# On the first call note the changed post-threads, so later you can check them
# on the site and hide all other posts in a thread if you want a thread to stay hidden.
