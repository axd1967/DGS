# From here on up development continued on MAIN-branch as continuation
# after release DGS 1.0.13 on 19-Dec-2007 till 03-Nov-2008,
# then development on branch DGS-stable-200712 is included below,
# ending in release DGS 1.0.14
#
# All changes between releases DGS 1.0.13 (CVS-tag dev-start-20081116)
# and DGS 1.0.14 (CVS-tag DGS-stable-200812) are merged into the MAIN-branch,
# which is included in this ChangeLog starting at 29-Dec-2008 above.
#
# DDL-changes for release 1.0.14 are NOT repeated within the merge,
# because those changes are already performed on the live-server
# and they are not conflicting with development on the MAIN-branch.
