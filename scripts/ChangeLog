   - save and activate inactive conditional-moves on my or opponents turn
     - added activation of conditional-moves as two-step process if it is my turn:
       1. save conditional-moves as inactive,
       2. activate on submitting first move to allow optional move-message
     - splitted save and activation action for editing conditional-moves
     - added showing and editing of conditional-moves for already started sequence
     - reset start- and last-move data for editing of already started conditional-move sequence

       for preview of conditional-moves
