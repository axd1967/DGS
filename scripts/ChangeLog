   * include/sgf_parser.php (SgfParser.sgf_parser; class GameSgfParser, ~.__construct, ~.get_error,
       ~.verify_game_attributes, ~.verify_game_shape_setup, ~.verify_game_moves, ~.parse_sgf_game),
     include/conditional_moves.php (ConditionalMoves.load_cond_moves_from_sgf),
     include/game_sgf_control.php (GameSgfControl.verify_game_sgf),
     include/board.php (Board.prepare_verify_game_sgf),
     game.php (draw_conditional_moves_input),
     goban_editor.php (load_igoban_from_sgf):
   - adjusted SGF-game-verification from attaching-SGF to be re-used for parsing and
     checking uploaded SGF with conditional-moves
     - added SGF-game-verification for uploaded conditional-moves from SGF on identical
       game-attributes, shape-setup and played moves
     - added option to enable checking PASS-moves on SGF-game-verification
     - identify start of conditional-moves in uploaded SGF
     - refactored GameSgfControl::prepare_verify_game_sgf() into Board-class to be re-used for
       parsing and checking uploaded SGF with conditional-moves
     - refactored checking of game-attributes, shape-setup and played moves from GameSgfControl-class
       into GameSgfParser-class
     - convert SGF PASS-notation with B/W[tt] for board-size <= 19 to standard B/W[]
     - bugfix for GameSgfParser.parse_sgf_game(): parse certain game-attribute SGF-properties
       only in root-node
   - bugfix goban-editor: also show SGF-parsing errors on uploading shape from SGF
