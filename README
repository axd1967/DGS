Currently SourceForge.net does not support branch-specific access-permissions.

The repository with URL:

    ssh://USER@git.code.sf.net/p/dragongoserver/dgs-work

can be used as shared working place to work on branches and integrate branches
for developers of the dragongoserver project, while integrators work on the
main repository of the project with URL:

    ssh://USER@git.code.sf.net/p/dragongoserver/dgs-main

You can also use other remote servers (like github.com), but please use the same
conventions on git-usage and committing as described below!


Conventions and How to use the work-area (replace upper-case words with your setting):

   1. get a SourceForge account USER
   2. ask project-admin to add your USER in user-group 'Workers'
   3. install git on your local machine
   4. config user and email in git:

      # CONVENTION-NOTE: use the SourceForge-mail-address and use your full name!
      git config user.name "FIRSTNAME LASTNAME"
      git config user.email "USER@users.sf.net"

   # create local working-dir and create empty repository
   mkdir WORK
   cd WORK
   git init

   # add remote server (as Worker you only have read-only access to the 'main' repository)
   git remote add main ssh://USER@git.code.sf.net/p/dragongoserver/dgs-main
   git remote add work ssh://USER@git.code.sf.net/p/dragongoserver/dgs-work

   # shows all branches (including master branch)
   git remote show main

   # download repository: BRANCH = optional to fetch all branches, else specific branch-name to fetch
   git fetch main [BRANCH]

   # open own branch by cloning 'main/master'
   # CONVENTION-NOTE: prefix your branch with your SHORTNAME or USER (at least when pushing to work-repository)
   git checkout -b SHORTNAME/branch-name main/master

   # CONVENTION to save on remote work-area (for sharing or backup)
   git push work SHORTNAME/branch-name

More conventions can be found in the main-master branch in 'scripts/README.developers'.

Have fun!
