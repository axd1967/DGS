This file explains how to contribute to the DGS project.

NOTE:
   Currently SourceForge.net does not support branch-specific access-permissions.
   That's the reason for a 2nd work repository (also referred to as the "work-area")
   as outlined in this documentation.


The repository with URL:

    ssh://USER@git.code.sf.net/p/dragongoserver/dgs-work

can be used as shared working place to work on branches and integrate branches
for developers of the dragongoserver project, while integrators work on the
main repository of the project with URL:

    ssh://USER@git.code.sf.net/p/dragongoserver/dgs-main

You can also use other remote servers (like github.com), but please use the same
conventions on git-usage and committing as described below!


Here are the conventions on how to use the dgs-work repository (replace upper-case words with your setting):

   1. get a SourceForge account USER
   2. ask project-admin to add your USER in user-group 'Workers'
   3. install Git on your local machine
   4. config user and email in Git:

      # CONVENTION-NOTE: use the SourceForge-mail-address and use your full name!
      git config user.name "FIRSTNAME LASTNAME"
      git config user.email "USER@users.sf.net"

   5. [optional] To ease the authentification with SourceForge you can upload your
      public-SSH-key in your SF user account. See  http://sourceforge.net/account/services

   # create local working-dir and create empty repository
   mkdir WORK
   cd WORK
   git init

   # add remote server (as Worker you only have read-only access to the 'dgs-main' repository)
   git remote add dgs-main ssh://USER@git.code.sf.net/p/dragongoserver/dgs-main
   git remote add dgs-work ssh://USER@git.code.sf.net/p/dragongoserver/dgs-work

   # show all branches from the main rep (including master branch)
   git remote show dgs-main

   # download repository: BRANCH = optional to fetch all branches, else specific branch-name to fetch
   git fetch dgs-main [BRANCH]

   # open own branch by cloning 'dgs-main/master'
   # CONVENTION-NOTE: prefix your branch with your SHORTNAME or USER (at least when pushing to dgs-work)
   git checkout -b SHORTNAME/branch-name dgs-main/master

   # NOTE: if previous checkout did not work, try this first:
   git remote update

   # CONVENTION to save on remote work-area (for sharing or backup)
   git push dgs-work SHORTNAME/branch-name

   # to have your work branch integrated, notify a dgs-main maintainer
   (FIXME: currently it looks like this should be done via DGS, there is no obvious way to contact a dev via SF)

   # once a branch has been dealt with, consider deleting it to keep the noise level down in dgs-work.

More conventions can be found in the main-master branch in 'scripts/README.developers'.

Have fun!
