#-------- Various ----------------------------------------------

- forming 2 teams playing against each other
- alternating players
  - switching color on each next move
  - TeamGo needs 2 cyclers, ZenGo needs only 1 cycler
- team consists of 1-N players
- match-mode: equal team-size, min/max-team-size
- forming of teams, order within teams
- table-design

- ZenGo may be implemented as similar variant of TeamGo:
  - influencing order of players only ONE team (cycling through players),
  - N players, N should be odd (otherwise it's like TeamGo)
  - zen-mode (own game-type but similar game-model):
    only one team rotating players (with odd number of players)

- big problems:
   - time counted for TEAM (color) !! not players -> so 2 timers (B+W)
   - which timezone to use for timers? - alternatives:
     - a) TZ selected by player-to-move (most simple)
     - b) TZ of game-master
     - c) TZs set by game-master
     - d) TZ of server
   - handle players on vacation:
      - L: if one player on vacation -> team on vacation
      - L: if one player on vacation -> time stalled for game
      - L: if one player on vacation -> other players can move for him (skip-player-on-vacation)
        - game stalls on vacation
        - can be game-option, or
        - can be choice if users starts vacation (allow other players to play for me -> but disturbs order)
          if option is set -> player is skipped (who's next to move), even if normally a vacationer can play
      - problem is, that a player on vacation can still play normally
      - problem is, that a team may consist of 1..n players against different number of opponents, so the bigger team may compensate time with more vacation

#-------- Related features -------------------------------------

* Beware of invitation-DISPUTEs !!
  - invited-player can dispute with game-master, but there are different players
  => check, if invitation is a good way to start team-games (may be restricted to "special" waiting-room)

* Q: Are all players equal or is there a game-master ?
  => IMHO for setup game there is a game-master (the one inviting others or posting game-offer)
  => during game there is no game-master

* Q: is Admin functionality needed to exchange players (if player "escaped") ? - need GAME_ADMIN

* Q: stats about played TeamGo-games ? - Players.TeamGo-counter ?

* Functionality / Rights for game-master:
  - make a new game-offer in waiting-room
    - accept challengers on game-offer in waiting-room
    - deny challengers on game-offer in waiting-room, is this possible ?
    - "set" some initial players (same or different team)
  - invite other users
  - can define order of players (optional)
  - can define team-assignment (optional)
  - setup handicap / komi (optional); what if player is unrated? -> game-master decides
  - choose timezones (?) -> probably better to use TZ of current player to move
  => Needs kind of "chat" between players (message system, related to game)

* Game-properties for TeamGo:
  - (condition): players must be unique (trust!); at least 3 players
  - define DGS-maximum of attending players: 16

  - option to balance teams
  - game-settings: board-size, ruleset, handicap/komi/color, handicap-placement, time-setting

* Game-lists:
  - not sufficient to list by B|W-id alone, list by Team OR representative OR last moved player
  - handle opponents-page
  - handle pages with all/user/my finished/running/observed/observing games

* Nice would be revised game-page with full game-message-list in <div>-tag

* Nice would be additional "public" game-chat (similar to wanted review-comments):
  any number at any time by everyone, but restricted to players to be "public"

* Need multi-receivers-message

* Need way to ask partner if it's okay to resign

* Need adjusted scoring-step for multi-players (all players must pass/approve)

* No conditional moves for TeamGo-games!

* New-game: add description with specialties of game
  for Team-Go: special treatment of players on vacation (team-vacation)

* Rengo-SGF-download: include who's moving name -> use what SGF-props ?

* Rengo: disallow team-talk, but how? -> not possible (only by trust)
