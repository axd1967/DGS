The 'Handle'-columns are VARCHARs and whatever charset is used,
those are case-insensitive, except when a case-sensitive
collation is used on them (one with _cs-suffix).

What do you mean by "it is rebuilt ...". How exactly ?

No. They never will work in the same way, as long as those are
different mysql-versions. Well maybe mysql 4.1 and 5.0 are work
in the same, but certainly not mysql 4.0 and that is the main
problem:
- SF: mysql 4.1
- live-server: mysql 4.0
- local: mysql 4.0, 4.1 or 5.0

Especially the translation texts are showing the biggest
problematics. Making the translation-english text case
insensitive might not be so easy.
At the moment, the following fields are using a blob-datatype:
- TranslationTexts.Text
- Translations.Text
- Translationlog.OldTranslation
- Translationlog.Translation

A BLOB is a binary field, which has NO charset or collation
and therefore the sorting is based on the numeric values of the
bytes in that binary-string. So the ASCII-order makes it case-
sensitive. Adding a charset and/or collation is not possible
for a BLOB (or has no effect as long as it is a binary).
More Info: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/blob.html

The only chance to make it case-insensitive is to alter it
into a TEXT-datatype, which has a charset and collation.
BUT the problem is, that on the live-server there is no utf8
charset. And you certainly would not want to use charset latin1,
because that would loose data. I assume, the reason, why the
translation-texts are stored in BLOBs is, that the live-server
has no utf8-charset (mysql 4.0).

Another point to mention is, that on mysql 4.0 whatever charset
is used for a TEXT-column, the sorting and comparison is using
the servers character set.

I'm afraid that before making a change to the translation-texts
we need mysql 4.1 on the live-server. Some time ago i asked
Erik about it (he wanted to ask his provider, though I got
not answer to that yet).

You may also note, that the latin1_swedish_ci is the default
collation for the latin1-charset !

So, I wouldn't be too upset about the latin1_swedish_ci.
Nothing wrong with that. That would only pose a problem,
if you are unsatisfied with the ordering of the strings.
Do you know the exact difference of latin1_general_ci
and the latin1_swedish_ci ? I guess, it's very small.

To test it, you may create a copy of a table using another
collation and see, if the order or comparison changed
and what you prefer. It might not be clear which collation
is most suitable for a given application, so testing it
can be helpful to perform some comparisons with representative
data values to make sure that a given collation sorts values
the way you expect.

About some mixing of latin1-charsets on the live-server,
I can't tell, because I have no access to it.


However having some utf8-charset might be disturbing when
you only want one charset. I assume you speak about the
Sourceforge devel-server (mysql 4.1). That's the only one
that can have utf8 ;)

The database default is utf8. That can be altered of course.
It has only effect on new tables.

The only other tables using a utf8-charset in some way are:
- Adminlog: might be converted from utf8 to latin1,
   because the column IP is the only varchar-field,
   and IP-strings should only contain latin1-chars

- FAQ: might be converted from utf8 to latin1, because the
   only column Hidden does only store Y/N, which makes no
   encoding problems

I've detected one more difference in used collations.
That is on the Posts-table: The column PosIndex uses
a binary-collation 'latin1_bin'.

Another difference i detected is that on some tables
(i think those would be log-tables), there is a trigger-
attribute defined. Can the data_export-script export
the collations and additional attributes of a column
too ?

Not quite. You mix up some problems in one sentence.
utf8 and latin1 are charsets. The swedish/english i'm not
so sure what you mean: the collation or potential texts
in the database.
Whatever, a swedish text and a english text can both be
stored in either a column that uses utf8 or latin1 charset.

What causes a problem, would be to copy data from a utf8-
column into a latin1 column, when it contains non-latin1-
encodings. Then we loose data. But as long as we don't
do this, this is no problem.

It might be justified to have different charsets on
different columns as i've explained before in an earlier
mail.

maybe not ;)
I read it in more detail now ...


>> To do what? What is he proposing?


He proposes to dump the database, convert it to UTF8 and the
re-import it. That is of course not so easy, as he proposes :(

That is only possible, if the server is supporting
utf8, if we use the right charsets on the tables and have
converted all data. But then we done it already ;)

Are the translation-texts not already stored as utf8 on the
live-server (in the BLOB) ?



>> The better encoding converter I've found is my browser!


Sadly, the browser won't help us for converting our
databases :(

BTW, where do you live (France or another timezone) ?
or are you really up that late (around 3:00 ;-?

It seems it's a feature of mysql 4.1:
For timestamps you can give a default value 'CURRENT_TIMESTAMP',
that automatically set it to the current timestamp, when
an update is performed on an entry.

We must keep in mind this (and check it... and maybe add a
line in init.mysql)
Actually, only the database comparison rejects the Handles
with only case differences when someone create his account.
We already have had some guys trying to usurpe an other
account by using a really similar Name+Handle... so I've
have recently added a piece of code to reject the zero in
place of a O, the 1 in place of a I(upper i) or l(lower L)
and the 5 in place of a S... This had caused a bad affair
when 0soitz was posting in the forums in place of Osoitz.

I mean that we can change the properties of this column as
it may be rebuilt from scratch.

Ok. We will not do that.
So, we have to sort the field with PHP if needed! :(

I don't know... but if living with BLOBs allow us to get
free of UTF-8 database problem, that's not so bad.
We have just to remove the UTF-8 from the fields of the
devel server.

Is that a general fact or a particularity of our database?

Yes

I've created this column few weeks ago!!! Is it possible
that my "defaults" set it to UTF-8? Where can I check that?

Again a column I've created!!! :(

Yes. good. The lower case letters must be sorted after the
'Z'. Else we have to change the $order_str in
forum_functions.php.

Actually, I was interested to remove the "server
differences" with data_export to allow an easier comparison.
So, I was removing those infos that does not exist on all
the servers.

Do we need that?
If BLOBs are good to record the UTF-8 strings, that's good
for us. We don't need to compare the foreign strings, just
to keep them unchanged.

Since a couple of years, I only add a new language in UTF-8
(since my bad experiences with japanese and slovak).
I also try to find some translators to re-translate the
not-UTF-8 languages into UTF-8 (thanks to kaput who had
translated the two chinese versions... of course I'm unable
to check his work but he had worked a lot during a month)
But there is still some old languages (like thaï) I can't
success.
Actually on the live-server, the known languages are:
------
1  sv.iso-8859-1  Swedish
2  no.iso-8859-1  Norwegian
3  en.iso-8859-1  English
4  de.iso-8859-1  German
5  fr.iso-8859-1  French
6  es.iso-8859-1  Spanish
7  cs.iso-8859-2  Czech
8  zh.big5  Chinese (Traditional)
9  pt.iso-8859-1  Portuguese
10 zh.gb2312   Chinese (Simplified)
11 nl.iso-8859-1  Dutch
12 th.tis-620  Thai
14 fi.iso-8859-1  Finnish
15 ko.euc-kr   Korean
16 ru.windows-1251   Russian
17 pl.iso-8859-2  Polish
18 it.iso-8859-1  Italian

Maybe yes... but manually.
What I've found is:
- as far as I know, the PHP does not have good converters
(iconv does not works even between two japanese encodings)
- the browsers manage a lot of charsets and have been tested
a lot more that any little free converter that we may find
on the net.
- they know how to input many encodings.

My solution to convert encodings is to open two browser
windows, one for each encoding. For example, two DGS
translate pages. Then I cut&past from one to the other...
and it works rather fine!
