#-------- (1) Introduction ----------------------------------------------------

A "multi-player-game" (= MPG / MP-game) on DGS is an unrated game played by more
than two unique players, alternatingly playing Black and White moves in two teams
or in one team.

The most common form of a MP-game is Rengo (or Pair-Go with one male and one female),
both being special forms of Team-Go (2:2).

There are three game-types to differ:

   Go (1:1)      = standard 2-player game: Black vs White

   Team-Go (N:M) = two teams (Black vs White) with in sum more than 2 players,
                   each team consists of 1-n players, with N + M > 2

   Zen-Go (N)    = one team with more than 2 players alternating Black & White play,
                   N must be odd, with N > 2

The players must be unique per game, so no player can join a MP-game more than once.
Also all players must have a valid rating to calculate average ratings of the teams.
So, even though a MP-game is unrated, a users rating is required.

Restrictions:
   * At maximum, 16 players can participate in a MP-game.
   * Tournaments are NOT supported with multi-player-games.
   * Double games are NOT supported for multi-player-games.
   * No team-accounts are supported (also see below "out of scope").
   * Multi-player-games are not (always) shown in the normal game-lists
     like all/user/my finished/running/observed/observing games,
     because the games normally selected by the black- or white-player are only
     some of ALL the players within a multi-player-game.
     To compensate there is a special search to list multi-player-games.
   * Opponents-page is only supported for standard Go-games,
     but NOT for multi-player-games.
   * Multi-player-game can NOT be deleted, except on SETUP-status by game-master.
   * Conditional moves are NOT supported for multi-player-games.


Out of Scope:
   This approach does not support team-accounts, though the team-data is preserved.
   This means, there is no explicit history of the accomplishments of teams.
   This would make no sense for Zen-Go, only for Team-Go.

   It is still possible to share an account, but there is no direct support
   by the server for it. This approach has been chosen, because of easier
   implementation avoiding all "team"-stuff (incl. ratings, team-handling).

#-------- (2) Users Guide -----------------------------------------------------

The "official rules" can be found on: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Rengo

Normally during a MP-game it's not allowed to speak with each other about the games to play.
The only practical allowed consultation on DGS is to ask if you can resign the game.
And though it may be officially forbidden, such talkings can not be prevented anyway.
However, it's considered to be much more fun in a MP-game NOT to speak about the moves
in advance.

#-------- (2a) Setup MP-game --------------------------------------------------

Described Use-cases:
   - Create new MP-game
   - Find users to play with with "game-players"-page
     - [I] Invite a specific (single) known player
     - [W] Add a game-offer in the waiting-room
   - Remove a joined player
   - Choose group-color and handicap for players
   - Choose group-order for players
   - Delete game
   - Start game


* Create new MP-game:

  1. Select "New multi-player-game" on the "new_game"-page

  2. Specify game-settings: All these settings can NOT be changed later !!

     - ruleset, board-size

     - handicap-stone placement:
       regardless of handicapped game or not

     - game-type & game-players:
       Choose number of players and type of MP-game, e.g:

          3   => Zen-Go with 3 players
          5   => Zen-Go with 5 players

          2:2 => Team-Go with 4 players, 2 vs 2, aka "Rengo"
          1:3 => Team-Go with 4 players, 1 vs 3

     - time-settings

   3. Add game: This will create a new MP-game in SETUP-mode and forward you to
      the "game-players"-page to manage the MP-game.

      The player that created a MP-game is referred to as "game-master" and
      marked as such ("Master") on the "game-players"-page.

   * Additional Infos:
      - All MP-games you "manage" are listed on the status-page as long as they
        are in SETUP-mode, i.e. not started and running yet
      - The "userinfo"-page shows the current number of MP-games in setup/running-mode,
        but only for oneself or viewed by admins
      - For MP-games in SETUP-mode the game-page and game-info-page are not available
      - Game in SETUP-mode can only be deleted by game-master


* Find users to play with with "game-players"-page:
  The game-master already joined the game taking a slot, and is marked as "master".

  There are two ways to find willing players for your MP-game in SETUP-mode:

     [I] - Invite a specific (single) known player
     [W] - Add a game-offer in the waiting-room

  Important Note:
      [I] and [W] can also be used at the same time, though if you want
      to start a MP-game with your usual buddy, first use [I], set up groups,
      then start with adding a game-offer in the waiting-room [W], so the users
      can see against whom they have to play and in which groups.
      Naturally you can also use only [I], if you know all the players that
      want to join your MP-game.


* [I] Invite a specific (single) known player:

  1. Show "game-players"-page and select "Invite"

  2. Specify the user-id of the user you want to invite
     - the user is checked, errors are listed, e.g. user must have a rating
     - if the user is valid, a reservation is added and you will be forwarded
       to the "send-message"-page to inform the user about the invitation
     - A template-text is shown together with a preview. You may edit the text
       (or translate it) as you like, but be sure the main information about
       the invitation is included in some form.
     - Sending the message will forward the message to the invited user
       as normal message.

  3. The invited user hopefully sees the message.
     When the invited user follow the link in the message and with that entering
     the "game-players"-page, he sees a reserved slot for his invitation.
     He will automatically be asked to join the MP-game. Then the invited user can:

        a) accept the invitation, or
        b) reject the invitation

     Additionally he might want to reply to your invitation-message with additional
     information or questions before or after acceptance/rejection.

  4. When the user does not respond or as long as the invited user has not
     accepted/rejected the invitation, the game-master can:

     c) send a reminder:
        To send a reminder, from the "game-players"-page click on the "Invite"-image
        in the Actions-column for the specific reserved-slot of the invited user.
        Re-enter/edit some text and send the message.

     d) delete the reserved invitation:
        To delete the reservation, click on the "Trashcan"-image in the
        Actions-column for the invited user. You will be asked for confirmation
        of the deletion.


* [W] Add a game-offer in the waiting-room:

  1. Show "game-players"-page and select "Add to waiting-room"

     - Specify how many user-slots you may wish to offer in the waiting-room
     - If you want, specify some more game-settings for:
       rating-range, number of rated finished games, waiting-room comment
     - After "adding" a game-offer, a waiting-room entry is added.
       In the waiting-rooms 'Info'-page and in the Settings-column,
       a link to the corresponding "game-players"-page is shown

     - Only one waiting-room offer can be created at one time (easier implementation)
       restricted to one set of game-offer-settings.
     - To use a different game-offers, a former waiting-room game-offer has to be
       fulfilled or deleted first.
     - The waiting-room entry can be deleted at any time.
       The entry can be easily found via the "game-players"-page (maybe reload first).

  2. When a user matches the game-offer criteria, he/she can join the MP-game-offer
     and will automatically be added in a free (reserved) waiting-room-slot.


* Remove a joined player:

  A user may notify the game-master about to be removed from the MP-game,
  or the game-master no longer wants the participation of an already joined
  player (for whatever reason). In the latter case politeness dictates, that
  the game-master informs the to-be-removed player about this decision.

  To remove a joined player, click on the "Trashcan"-image in the Actions-column
  for the joined player you want to remove. You will be asked for confirmation
  of the removal.


* Choose group-color and handicap for players:

  Notes:
  - Only the game-master can change the color and order of players.
    So the players have to discuss with the game-master about the player-settings.

  There are 5 different group-colors:

      BW = black or white
      B  = black
      W  = white
      G1 = group 1
      G2 = group 2

  The group-colors 'G1' and 'G2' can be useful to setup a certain team of starting
  players for Team-Go without setting a particular color yet. For Zen-Go only 'BW'
  makes sense, because there's only one team for all players.

  For Team-Go before the game can start, the colors for all players must be set
  to either 'B' or 'W'. In "Change Color & Handicap" (for Team-Go) the game-master
  has to choose the groups (setting color) and choosing the handicap-stones and
  komi for the MP-game. If 'B/W' or 'G1/G2' are chosen, the average-ratings of the
  players and handicap suggestions are shown, which may help in building teams.

  For Zen-Go only the handicap-stones and komi can be chosen.


* Choose group-order for players:

  Notes:
  - Only the game-master can change the color and order of players.
    So the players have to discuss with the game-master about the player-settings.

  Before the game can be started, the playing order for each team must be specified.
  This can be done following the "Change order" on the "game-players"-page.


* Delete game:

  While the game is on SETUP-status the game can be deleted, but only by the game-master.
  The deletion must be confirmed. The other players are notified about the deletion.


* Start game:

  To start the game, the game-master should follow the link "Start game"
  on the "game-players"-page. Some errors might be shown, preventing that
  the game can be started. In that case, fix them first.

  1. Before starting the game, the game-master may want to send a bulk-message
     to all game-players by selecting the link "Send message to all game-players".
     You may edit the message before sending it.
     After sending, a multi-receiver bulk-message is sent to all given game-players.

     This would be the last chance to back off from the game by telling the game-master,
     which is able to remove an already joined player. After this point, no player
     can be removed and the MP-game can NOT be deleted.

  2. "Start game" finally starts the game and leaves the SETUP-mode for the MP-game.
     Every game-player will be notified with a server-message about the game-start.


#-------- (2b) Info MP-game ---------------------------------------------------

Described Use-cases:
   - Show MP-games in SETUP-mode -> see (1) Status-page, (2) Quick-Status-page
   - Show GameType -> see (1) Status-page, (2) Quick-Status-page, (3) Game-info-page
   - Show list of MP-games -> see (4) Games-List-page
   - Show info about MP-game in SETUP-mode or running/finished MP-game -> see next section [2c]


* (1) Status-page "status.php":
   - GameType has been added for games to move in
   - section with MP-games in SETUP-mode has been added,
     visible for all participating game-players of MP-game

* (2) Quick-Status-page "quick_status.php":
   - GameType has been added for games to move in
   - section with MP-games in SETUP-mode has been added,
     visible for all participating game-players of MP-game
     -> see "specs/quick-suite.txt" (chapter 4.QST)

* (3) Game-Info-page "gameinfo.php":
   - GameType has been added showing game-type and game-player-count

* (4) Games-List-page "show_games.php":
   - MP-games are shown on normal games-list, but only if current player appears
     as Black- or White-player; otherwise MP-game is not showing up.
   - MP-games on SETUP-status are NOT shown in games-lists, only running MP-games

   - The full list of running (=started) or finished MP-games, a checkbox with
     a graphical symbol (of a group of 2 people) has been added in the added
     GameType-column-header. If checked and searched, only the full list of ones
     MP-games (where you participate) is listed. The title shows this "mode" with
     an appended text "(multi-player-games only)".

     This choice may lead to confusion when searching for MP-games.
     However, the choice for this separate search was done, because otherwise
     an additional join to the GamePlayers-table would have been needed
     to be done for every query on the usual games-list, which already is
     quite big and may be time consuming.

     - (4a) To search for a user-specific MP-game (MY/USER running/finished games),
       the checkbox in the GameType-column-header needs to be checked.

     - (4b) To search for a user-unspecific MP-game (ALL running/finished games),
       use the selection-box of the GameType-column to find "Non-std" games.

            - Delete reservation : delete slot-reservation for invitation

* (2) Game-comments-page "game_comments.php":
   - For MP-games the game-comments-page additional shows the player,
     that made the move/comment.

* (3) SGF-Download "sgf.php":
   - see also chapter (4.SGF) in "specs/quick_suite.txt"

   - For a MP-game the downloaded SGF contains additional information:
      - the player who moved is added in each game-node in format "name (user-id)"
        even if there is no move-message.
        This behaviour can be deactivated with a new option "mpg=1".
      - the user-IDs (space-separated) of the teams is added in SGF-properties WT/BT
      - Start/End-rating represents the average group-rating of the MP-game
      - Game Players (Order. Color: Name (Handle), Current Rating) is added in
        SGF-game-information.

* (4) Game-page "game.php":
   - MP-game is shown on status-page of player which is next to play.
   - Current player of MP-game is shown with a black/white-stone on the
     Game-Players-page.
   - Playing in a MP-game by submitting a move, changes also the 2nd-next
     player to move replacing the current player.

   - Resigning a MP-game:
     By official rules in Rengo, the current player wanting to resign,
     is inclined to ask his team-partner if it is ok with the phrase
     "May I resign?", on which the partner may answer with only "Yes" or "No".

     DGS is not enforcing this rule, but adds a note with a link
     to send a bulk-message to the other players of the same group/team
     to ask for resignation. But this lies in the discretion of the player
     to move. The link leads to showing a preview of a bulk-message to the
     correct partner-players with a link to the game.

     For Rengo it's pretty clear (only one answer), but for other MP-games
     with more than two partners in the same team, there might appear both
     answers (Yes & No). The interpretation of that is not enforced by DGS,
     which would be too complicated and unflexible bound to a specific
     ruling, and therefore left to decide for the one who asked about
     resignation.

   - Deleting a MP-game is NOT allowed at the moment.

     Reasoning: One player shouldn't "destroy" a game, that all agreed upon.
     If the player does not want to play, he should say so before the game
     is started or refuse from joining in the first place.
     Maybe this policy will be changed later.

     If a player wants to be removed from the MP-game it's only possible while
     the game has not been started in SETUP-mode. The player should send a private
     message to the game-master for removal, which the game-master can do on the
     Game-Players-page (see also section (2a)).

   - Ending a game is done by the player to move in a normal way.
     Normally one could expect that also before ending a MP-game, the player
     to move asks his team-partners if that is ok or if the game should continue.
     However, this was not done out of simplicity reasons. It may be still added
     with another bulk-message to ask for that.

* (5) Quick-suite "quick_do.php" and "quick_play.php":
   - see "specs/quick_suite.txt" for info about "MP-game" or "multi-player-game"


#-------- (3) Design, Classes and Files ---------------------------------------

* Table-Design:
  - needed to store
      - game-type (Go/Zen-Go/Team-Go) and number of players
      - count of: MP-games on SETUP-status, running MP-games

   * Games-table: added fields 'GameType' & 'GamePlayers',
     for description see "specs/db/table-Games.txt"

   * GamePlayers-table: for description see "specs/db/table-Games.txt"

   * Players-table: added field 'GamesMPG'
     for description see "specs/db/table-Players.txt"

   * Waitingroom-table: added fields 'GameType' & 'GamePlayers',
     for description see "specs/db/table-Waitingroom.txt" and "specs/db/table-Games.txt"

* Design behind playing MP-games:
   - The most important data is the field 'Games.Moves', which is increased
     with every move and therefore is used in combination with the
     'Handicap/GamePlayers'-fields and 'GamePlayers'-table to know which player
     is next to move in a MP-game. The player to move is calculated by
     "MultiPlayerGame::calc_game_player_for_move(..)" and the returned values
     have a direct correspondence with the players saved in the "GamePlayers"-table.

     So while moving the Black/White_ID in the "Games"-table is overwritten with
     the next and 2nd-next-player to move while the game goes along.

   - Official Rengo-rules requires, that the players of one team don't talk with
     one another, except when asking for resignation (or if ok to end a game).
     This can NOT be enforced on DGS anyway, so it is not prevented.
     But in order to some form of easier talking between the players with the
     game-master, a way to send bulk-messages has been added. Normally this
     should be restricted to ask if anybody is ready to start the MP-game or
     to allow asking the other team-members if resignation is ok.
     However, this lies in the discretion of the player to move, if he/she asks
     or not (a note with a link serves as a reminder to do so), but this is
     not enforced.

     Additionally the bulk-message feature can also be used for other purposes,
     though it is restricted for the initial sending of a message; it can not be
     used in a way similar to a "Reply-to-all" known from sending an email.

   - Playing MP-games is also supported via the quick-do- and quick-play-suite.

* Timing and vacation-handling for multi-player-game:
   - the choice not supporting real team-accounts allowed to use the existing
     time-handling for the black- and white-player of a game. That means,
     that while playing a MP-game, the Black and White-player are altered
     to reflect the current player to move. With this, the time-handling
     of the black/white-player is naturally used.

   - some back-draws are, that time-zone-changes could be used to cheat on time
     for teams with more than one player. This is not prevented as MP-games are
     meant for fun anyway and are always unrated.

     Also a player on vacation can play normally. So one problem is, that a team
     may consist of 1..N players against a different number of opponents, so the
     bigger team has the advantage of having more "free" time by the possibility
     of having more vacation.
     However, a MP-game is just for fun and unrated, so no special measures are
     taken to prevent vacation-abuse.

* Classes / Files:
   * "game_players.php" - page dedicated to setup/manage MP-games

   * class MultiPlayerGame - utility class to handle/support MP-games
   * class GamePlayer - Class to model 'GamePlayers'-entity
   * class GameHelper - general utility class to handle games

* Q: is Admin functionality needed to exchange players (e.g. if player "escaped") ?

* Q: stats about played TeamGo-games ? development of "teams" (regarding team-accounts) ?

* NTH: kind of "chat" between players could be useful (message system, related to game);
  Nice would be additional "public" game-chat (similar to wanted review-comments):
  any number at any time by everyone, but restricted to players to be "public"

* NTH: Game-properties for MP-games:
