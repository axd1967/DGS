Legend:
- T = Tournament
- TD = Tournament director
- TP = Tournament participant/player
- TV = Viewer of tournament
- Opp = opponent
- TL = tournament-ladder
- TRR = tournament-round-robin

Topics:

   1. Introduction
   X. Design, Classes and Files (implementation details)

   * Tournament = tourney = T : what it is, what it not is
   * types of tournaments : Ladders, Round Robin
   * scope of Ts: Dragon, Public, Private
   * tournament-process + status: ADM,NEW,REG,PAIR,PLAY,CLOSED,DEL
   * tournament-editing: locks
   * tables -> ddl-description
   * roles of T: T-Adm, TD, TP, TV(viewers)

   * GUI for T-Adm, for TD, for TP, for TV
      * page T-wizard: How to create new T (setting defaults)
      * page T-list
      * page T-info
      * page T-Manager
         -> common managing: info-section (T-info, owner, last-changed, changedby, my-role, flags, status)
         -> common managing: edit-locks, change-status, edit-T, news/bulletins, add TDs, edit-reg-props, edit-game-rules
         -> specifics for tournament-ladders.txt : edit-ladder-props
         -> specifics for tournament-round_robin.txt : change-round-status, edit-rounds
         -> common managing: edit-TPs
         -> specifics for tournament-ladders.txt : adm-ladder, edit-ladder, view-ladder
         -> specifics for tournament-round_robin.txt : def-pools, create-pools, edit-pools, edit-game-pairings
         -> common managing: admin-TG
         -> specifics for tournament-round_robin.txt : edit-ranks
      * page T-game-list
      * page TP-list
      * page TP-reg, TD-edit-reg
      * T-cron

   * ladder: "What happens with running games on user-removal ?"
      * use-cases for user-removal:
         (1) user removed by TD/T-Adm
         (2) user retreated from ladder
         (3) user removed by T-system (game-end ladder-config)
         (4) user removed by T-system (long-absence ladder-config)
      * user is removed from tournament-ladder (other users move up one rank)
      * users tournament user registration is removed
      * running games are "detached" (continued as normal games)
         * Games.Flags-detach set, Games made UNRATED (!)
         * TG.Flags-detach set, TG.Status=SCORE to be processed and challengesIn/Out corrected (time-delayed by cron)
         * "detached" can be seen on game-page, gameinfo-page, game-list for T
      * if user re-joins challengesIn/Out are corrected from ACTIVE (PLAY|SCORE) games
      * notify sent to user (except for (1))
      * notify sent to opponents of running games

   * Requirements / Backlog / Ideas:
      * see (local) specs/Tournaments.txt

#-------- Design Thoughts --------------------------------------

T-process:
   - T-creation
   - T-registration
   - T-confirmation (opt)
   - prepare T-round + T-games (auto/manually)
   - T-start: auto-start all games
   - (TPs playing games), TPs-game-end: gather results, end round, next round (prep)
   - T-close: report T-winners

T-use-cases / pages:
   - create new T
   - list Ts
   - view T

   - T-types: round robin (pooled), 1-n rounds with pools of 1..m TPs
