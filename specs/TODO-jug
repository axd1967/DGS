- 1 IDEA: [site] (S077.1) avoid expire-login-check on POSTs (potentially losing input-data): check "count($_POST)"(?) or "$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST'": http://www.dragongoserver.net/forum/read.php?forum=2&thread=47914#47914
- 1 IDEA: [site] (S077.3) avoid expire-login-check on some POSTs (edit-email/profile): check/replace GET-forms with POST-forms?;; http://www.dragongoserver.net/forum/read.php?forum=2&thread=47914#47914 -> checked others -> split {S077.2}, {S077.5}
