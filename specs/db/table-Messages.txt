## --- Messages ---

Description:
   Table to store message-content.
   Table MessageCorrespondents refers to this table containing the sender and receiver.

Important Notes:
   - run 'scripts/message_consistency.php' to check message-consistency
   - Message system is "misused" to handle game-offers, which has some drawbacks:
      - "assigning" all related messages for game-offer or after-game-messages is difficult to impossible
      - need redundant (but different work) to handle game-offers (waiting-room <-> message system)

#-------- Rod's answer -----------------------------------------
# JUG's Q: are you reluctant to use 2 from/to-cols instead of one?

Yes, I was reluctant to have 2 columns because one of the two cells is always yourself.
In fact, this is pending (small) problem.
The current design is mainly historical: we started with separate folders either
"from" or "to" (Main, Reply, Sent,...) then, some times later, added the move
message feature to realize that a folder could contain "from" AND "to" messages.
This layout could be adjusted but we disagree with having all the cells of
a "From/To" column containing either a "From:" or a "To:".
Maybe, the best solution (I think) is to have a new column "From/To" containing
small icons and replace the "From" header by "Correspondent". The pure "from"
or "to" folders will not have this new column and keep the "From" or "To" header as actually.


Right now, I think that you have answered your question by yourself.


By the way, about the "Messages":

1) I have had hard time with the "message to myself" feature.
   This was my first big work as a developer.
   Initially, the MessageCorrespondent table was only allowing the 'Y' and 'N'
   values for the "Sender" field. So when some users send a message to themself,
   this message was appearing in two of his folders with some bad side effect - like
   having to move and trash it two times while our code was not really able
   to distinguish the two references correctly. Then I added the 'M' (Myself) value
   for the "Sender" field and run a script to convert all the messages with identical
   sender/receiver as a "message to myself". But, as some users have already
   discarded some of them, it could remain some mess.

The actual rules for the "Sender" field are:
   - a sender (Y) and ONE receiver (N) row => normal message
   - a sender (Y) and x>1 receiver (N) rows => futur normal mass message. See below
   - only the M row => myself message
   - no sender row, only 'N' => system message (it means too: noreply)
   - only sender row => badly fixed old myself message (should not. if any, treat it as a 'M' row)
   - 'M' row and other rows => badly fixed old myself message (should not. if any, ignore the other rows)
Even if some (cursed) messages are not correctly identified with this rule, they are rather old now.

2) there is actually no more than ONE receiver for a message. The code could (I hope)
   accept one sender for multiple receivers (mass mail)... except for the message.php
   display... so we don't allow multiple userid in the "To" field.
   But this will be soon (alas, since few years right now). So, even if not effective,
   the 1 sender + x receiver rule must be followed. It will be activated at least if we add a BlackList / FriendList feature.



#-------- JUG - alternative table-design (highly experimental) -----------------------
# Version 1.0 A - has some drawback, unfinished, because of select-problems

preconditions:
   - a message has one and only ONE sender
   - a message has at least ONE (or more) receivers
   - the receiver can be me

# Message is representing the "sent" message and contains info about the sender
TABLE Messages: ID, Type, ReplyTo, Game_ID, Time, Subject, Text
   add columns:
      - uid = sending user (FK Players.ID), 0 for system-message
      - Folder_nr = folder messaged is stored in for user <uid>
      - Flags = RECEIVERS_PUBLIC (=CC instead of BCC) | MASS_MSG (to be able to mark it in table-list)

# Table is only representing the "receivers" of a message
# (-> maybe new table MessageReceivers)
TABLE MessageCorrespondents: ID, uid, mid, Folder_nr, Sender, Replied
   remove column:
      - Sender (table is only containing receivers, so not needed)

   semantics for columns:
      - uid = user (FK Players.ID) of receiving user, can also be me (msg to myself)
      - mid = FK Messages.ID, received message
      - Folder_Nr = current folder of message, needs special handling of myself-message (see below)
      - Sender - to be deleted
      - Replied - as it is now (Y=msg-replied, N=need-no-reply, M=need-reply)

# Note on handling messages:
- use-case: sending a message by a SENDER <sender> to one or more RECEIVERS <receiver1..n>
  DB-table entries:
    INSERT Messages (...,uid,Folder_nr) VALUES (...,<sender>,FOLDER_NEW)
    for each UNIQUE receiver 1..n:
      INSERT MessageCorrespondents (uid,mid,Folder_Nr,Replied) VALUES (<receiver>,mid,FOLDER_NEW,$replied)

  basic select for message of user <myID>:
    ( SELECT          -- search for 'sending'-msgs
         M.ID as mid, M.Type, M.ReplyTo, M.Game_ID, M.Time, M.Subject, M.Text, M.uid, M.Folder_nr, M.Flags,
         'Sender' as Correspondent,
         GROUP_CONCAT(P.Name SEPARATOR '#') as Recipients -- since Mysql 4.1
      FROM Messages M JOIN MessageCorrespondents MC ON M.ID=MC.mid
         JOIN Players P ON MC.uid=P.ID
      WHERE M.uid=<myID>
      GROUP BY MC.mid
    )

    UNION

    ( SELECT          -- search for 'received'-msgs
         M.ID as mid, M.Type, M.ReplyTo, M.Game_ID, M.Time, M.Subject, M.Text, M.uid, M.Flags,
         'Receiver' as Correspondent,
         MC.ID, MC.Folder_nr, MC.Replied
      FROM Messages M JOIN MessageCorrespondents MC ON M.ID=MC.mid
            JOIN Players P ON MC.uid=P.ID
      WHERE MC.uid=<myID>
    )

    - order on UNION ??

- downsize of this table-design is, that it needs 2 separate ways to change folder of message:
  one for Messages-table (sent), one for MessageCorrespondents-table (received).
  When a message appears only once (as sent OR received), it's easier to handle.


should only show up once (as sent or received, not both):
  For that, synchronizing Folder_nr is needed, so the following assertion is needed:
  assert(Messages.Folder_Nr == MessageCorrespondents.Folder_Nr)


#-------- JUG - alternative table-design -----------------------
# Version 1.0 B - started, dissatisfied with need of a UNION-select + order/limits

preconditions:
   - a message has one and only ONE sender (could be system)
   - a message has at least ONE (or more) receivers
   - the receiver can be myself

# Message is representing the "sent" message and contains info about the sender

   add columns:
      - uid = sending user (FK Players.ID); default 0 = system-message
      - Flags = PUBLIC_MSG (=CC instead of BCC) | MASS_MSG (to be able to mark it in table-list); default 0

# Table is only representing the "receivers" of a message
# (-> maybe new table MessageReceivers)
TABLE MessageCorrespondents: ID, uid, mid, Folder_nr, Sender, Replied
   remove column:
      - Sender (can be determined by comparing M.uid with MC.uid)
         M.uid == MC.uid -> message to myself
         M.uid != MC.uid AND M.uid=<myID>  -> message sent
         M.uid != MC.uid AND MC.uid=<myID> -> message received

      - mid = FK Messages.ID (message at hand)
      - Folder_Nr = current folder of message

#-------- JUG - alternative table-design -----------------------
# Version 1.0 C - started

# goal: avoid UNION, KISS

# design-note: back to the roots, design based on real-email-system (back to the roots)

Wanted features & restrictions:
   - allow messages from system (no direct uid, but use 0 instead maybe)
   - allow mass-message (message to more than one recipient)
   - allow public-message, that is all recipients cann "see" each other,
     that would allow a "reply-to-all"-feature (similar to Cc/Bcc known from email)
   - meet below preconditions
   - DB-efficiency (server-load), avoid "expensive" operations (like UNION-select for example)

preconditions:
   - a message has one and only ONE sender (could be system)
   - a message has at least ONE (or more) recipients
   - the recipient can be myself
   - a message is only showed as sent-message OR as received-message (not both); especially for myself-msg

A DGS-message is similar to an email. Let's take a look at an email.
An email consists of headers and body, comparison with current Messages-table:

    Email                   Messages
    ----------------------+--------------------------------------
    message-id (Header)     ID
    -                       Type
    Reference-id (Header)   ReplyTo
    -                       Game_ID
    Sent-Date (Header)      Time
    Subject (Header)        Subject
    Body                    Text
    To (Header)             -> MessageCorrespondents: Sender=Y, ...
    Cc, Bcc  (Header)       -
    Sent (Header)           -> MessageCorrespondents: Sender=N/M, ...

A difference i can spot, is that the 'To/Cc/Bcc/Sent' are part (attributes) of the email.
Transferred into DGS, i would propose the following table-design to handle messages:

Legend: FK=Foreign-Key

# Message is representing a pure-message with all its attributes:
#     ID/type/references/date/subject/text and also the sender and recipient(s)
TABLE Message (M):
   ID, Type, ReplyTo, Game_ID, Time, Subject, Text (as it is now)
   Sender    = FK Players.ID of user that sends the message, default=0 (system-message)
               # note: possible here, because a message can only have ONE sender
   Recipient = FK Players.ID of user that receives the message (also myself)
   Flags     = Bit-mask: default 0
               PUBLIC_MSG (indicating, that for mass-msg other recipients can be seen by each other, like 'Cc'-email-header)
               MASS_MSG   (indicating, that there are more than one recipient)
               REPLY_ALL  (optional-feature, force reply-to-all if one user answers)

   # note: if MASS_MSG-flag set, Recipient must contain first recipient,
   #       because MessageRecipients can't be efficiently queried in one SQL-statement.
   #       So we need at least to have one recipient to show in the message-table-list.
   #       Also if this flag set, MessageRecipients-entries must exist.

# m:n-Matrix containg the recipients for mass-messages (only informal, as attribute of a message)
# note: entries only present if more than one recipient
# note: for discussion: entries only present for non-system-message (assumed that it's never be a public-system-msg).
#       In fact, it can be argued, that only a non-system mass-message need entries
#       in this table, to determine recipients to be able to reply to.
#       Also public mass-messages need entries to correctly show recipients in table-list.
TABLE MessageRecipients (MR):
   mid = FK Messages.ID
   recipient = FK Players.ID

# table containing entries for sender and receivers to manage a message for a particular user
# note: corresponding to an email-storage-system (e.g. an IMAP-account)
# note: assuming sending msg to myself only adds one MS-entry
TABLE MessageStore (MS):
   ID, uid, mid, Folder_nr, Replied (as it is now, without Sender)

   # note: Sender-field not needed, it can be determined from other fields:
     M.Sender == MS.uid              == <myID>  -> message to myself
     M.Sender != MS.uid AND M.Sender == <myID>  -> message sent to other(s)
     M.Sender != MS.uid AND MS.uid   == <myID>  -> message received from other

TABLE Message (M): ID, Type, ReplyTo, Game_ID, Time, Subject, Text, Sender, Recipient, Flags
TABLE MessageRecipients (MR): mid, recipient
TABLE MessageStore (MS): ID, uid, mid, Folder_nr, Replied

# Handling messages:
- use-case: sending a message by a SENDER <sender> to one or more RECEIVERS <recipient1..n>
  DB-table entries:

    -- insert message
    $flags = 0;

    # makes only sense if mass-msg (and non-system-msg)
    if ( sender wants to send public-msg ) $flags |= PUBLIC_MSG;

    # some system-msgs can be considered a mass-msg (e.g. game-result), to avoid that system-msg is not treated as mass-msg
    if ( mass-msg ) $flags |= MASS_MSG;

    $recipient = (one recipient) ? <recipient1> : null;
    $mid = INSERT Message (..., Sender, Recipient, Flags) VALUES (..., <sender>, $recipient, $flags);

    if ( $flags & (PUBLIC_MSG | MASS_MSG) )
        INSERT MessageRecipients (mid, recipient) VALUES ($mid, <recipientX>);

    -- insert message into storage of sender
    INSERT MessageStore (uid,mid,Folder_Nr,Replied) VALUES (<sender>,mid,FOLDER_SENT,...)

    -- insert message into storage of recipients
    for each UNIQUE receiver 1..n:
        if receiver IS NOT <myID>; // which would be a myself-message
            INSERT MessageStore (uid,mid,Folder_Nr,Replied) VALUES (<receiver>,mid,FOLDER_NEW, ...)

  # system-message to one recipient <myID> (if needed)
      M:  ID=1,   Sender=0, Recipient=<myID>, Flags=0
      MS: ID=100, uid=<myID>,  mid=1, Folder=NEW, Replied=N
