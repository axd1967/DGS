## Fields:

* Parent_ID : int (FK id)
  - Posts.ID, the current post replies to
  - 0 for initial thread-post

* Thread_ID : int (FK id)
  - Posts.ID, which started the thread
  - appears in all Posts of the same thread

* Depth : int
  - Thread starter post has depth=1
  - Depth in the thread-tree, which is number of generations

* AnswerNr : int
  - Positional number starting with 1 (each child-tree-node starts with 1)
  - Number-position of siblings in the thread-tree with the same depth,
    i.e. posts to a parent post

* PosIndex : string
  - A string used to sort the posts in the thread using the database
  - The string is composed of the PosIndex of the parent post plus
    two letters, which encodes the AnswerNr in base 64, where the letters
    are given by $order_str (see forum/forum_functions.php).
    Any PosIndex will begin by '**' (2 times the first char of $order_str)
  - If PosIndex is empty, the post has been edited and is not active
