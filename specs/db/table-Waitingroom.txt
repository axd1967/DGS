## --- Waitingroom ---

Description:
   Table to store game-offers from user who search for game challenges.

Important Note:
   - Must be kept synchron with table 'TournamentRules' for fields relevant for tournaments.
   - Must be kept synchron with 'Invite'-feature, but Invites have less features,
     because of the manual nature of an invitation. Also the settings for invitations
     are kept in the Games-table.
   - Invitations using the Message-system will be removed in the future and
     migrated into the waiting-room.
