#-------- (1) Introduction ----------------------------------------------------

The Filters-Framework provides support to build SQL-queries with restrictions
on SQL-fields in an easy and flexible way. A "filter" is comprised by the
following items:

   - a filter-type
   - a specification of corresponding SQL-field(s) you want to restrict
   - input-form-element(s) for GUI allowing to enter or select values
   - a syntax-description for the values to enter
   - a mapping to transform entered values into parts of a SQL-query

A filter can also be used without the presentational part (form-elements),
though the normal usage is to show the input-elements in a separate form
or together with a table listing of data to select from the database.

Values entered with the form-elements of a filter are parsed by the filter-
framework according to the specific filters' syntax and transformed into
a SQL-part that contributes to a main SQL-query used to select data from
the database.


#-------- (2) Classes and Files -----------------------------------------------

This section shortly describes the framework-classes and files, additional
supporting classes and functions as well as filter-extensions of the Table
and Form-class (classes are given in braces "{ ClassName }" ). For more
details you may also check the source-code documentation of the classes,
their variables and functions.

   - include/filter.php:
     Contains main classes with container { SearchFilter } to manage different
     filters and various predefined filters { Filter } specialized on some
     DGS-table-columns.

   - include/filter_functions.php:
     internal helping functions used for filters

   - include/filter_parser.php:
     Containing classes to parse numeric-values { NumericParser}, texts
     { TextParser} and dates { DateParser } supporting several basic syntaxes
     like range-syntax or using wildcards.

   - include/tokenizer.php:
     Classes to parse and split a string into tokens with support of different
     quote-types (escaping, quoting, doubling) and special characters
     according to a basic underlying syntax { StringTokenizer, XmlTokenizer },
     the latter used for search-term-hightlighting for example.

   - include/std_classes.php:
     - Class { QuerySQL } is used to specify more complex SQL-query-parts to be
       used together with single filters.
     - Class { RequestParameters } is a container for key-value pairs provding
       a common interface to be used to transport vars per URL or form-hiddens.


   - include/table_columns.php:
     A Table { Table } can be equipped with filters to be applied on the
     different table-columns.

   - include/form_functions.php:
     Added two new elements 'FILTER' and 'FILTERERROR' to be used with the
     class { Form } adding filters and its error-messages within an form.


   - code_examples/filter_example.php:
     Filter-Example showing three different usages of filters with and without
     using Table-class and external Form.

   - code_examples/filter_example2.php:
     Filter-Example showing all available filter-types and all available
     configs you can use to change the behaviour and layout of filters.

   - code_examples/query_sql.php:
     Examples for use of the class { QuerySQL }.

#-------- (3) Users Guide -----------------------------------------------------

This section contains several subsections, you may be interested in:

   - How to add filters to a page
   - What filters are available
   - Standard syntax for numerics and texts
   - How to create a filter
   - How to specify SQL-queries
   - Reference to examples
   - Page-links and form-elements
   - How to combine tables, forms and additional URL-vars with filters
   - How to manage different filter-sets on one page


Filters can be used with a static form (only), can be included in a Table
or can be used as static external form together with a Table with or
without Table-Filters. Additional support is possible to include
more variables passed via URL.

In general, filters can also be used without any form, but then the use of
a filter is restricted on the parsing of a value and building a SQL-query.
But this is a special case, which is not described.

# ----- add filters to a page

You need the following steps to include filters on your page building a query,
which should be restricted on certain SQL-fields. The global order of
instructions is important and must not be changed:

   # creates main-containter for (grouped) filters
   $filter = new SearchFilter();

   # add filters
   # (when used with Table, the filter- and table-column IDs must match)
   $filter->add_filter( id1, type1, dbfield1, active1, config1);
   $filter->add_filter( id2, type2, dbfield2, active2, config2);
   $filter->init();   # parse values from URL into filters

   # add filters to Table
   $table = new Table(...);
   $table->register_filter( $filter );
   $table->add_or_del_columns();

   # from here on, values/results from Table and Filters can be retrieved

   # columns-specification for table
   $table->add_tablehead( id, ...);

   # extract resulting SQL-query from table and/or filters
   $qsql = $table->get_query();
   # or in other cases: $qsql = $filter->get_query();

The last statement returns a SQL-query represented in a QuerySQL-object
that is combining the restrictions of all added filters. The final SQL-query
as string can be extracted with:

   # merge with basic-query
   $query = $qsql->get_select();

# ----- filter-types

Several special filters are implemented (for syntax and special configuration
check out the documentation at the respective Filter-class and have a look
at the code-examples):

   - FilterNumeric        - numeric values (positive integers or doubles)
   - FilterText           - text-based values
   - FilterRating         - rank-values
   - FilterCountry        - selection of country
   - FilterDate           - dates
   - FilterRelativeDate   - relative- and/or absolute dates
   - FilterSelection      - select one or more of some choices
   - FilterBoolSelect     - select 'Y' or 'N' or all
   - FilterRatedSelect    - special Bool-Select for Rated-SQL-field
   - FilterBoolean        - boolean-selection of 'Y' or 'N'
   - FilterMysqlMatch     - special MysqlMatch-syntax
   - FilterScore          - score-values
   - FilterRatingDiff     - double-values representing rating-difference
   - FilterCheckboxArray  - selection of multiple checkboxes

# ----- standard syntax for numerics and texts

There are some standard syntaxes for text- and numeric-based filters
searching for:

   * exact value (numerics + texts):
     17   foo

   * ranges (numerics + texts):
     3-7  3-  -7   a-e  a-  -e

   * wildcard-matching (texts):
     foo*bar*
     *baz (starting wildcard not allowed by default)

   * special-syntaxes for ...
     - Rating: allow full syntax of read_rating()-func in "include/rating.php"
     - RelativeDate: combines absolute date-syntax from Date-Filter and
       relative date-syntax using ">30", see filter-class documentation
     - MysqlMatch (for boolean-mode): see filter-class-documentation

The above cases uses "special characters" (range-char '-', wildcard-char '*'),
which need to be escaped. For that purpose, the filter-framework provides
three different quote-types (at the moment the default is using escape-char).
Examples to escape the range-char '-':

   * escape by escape-char: a\-e
   * escape by quote-chars: 'a-e'  or  a'-'e  or  a'-e'
   * escape by doubling:    a--e

However, so  far there is no way to obtain the following within a single
filter (the first three are also potential inefficient queries, that should
be avoided if possible):

   * <>value
   * <de OR >do
   * =v1 OR =v2   => a future enhancement may allow this using lists: v1,v2
   * complex SQL, using UNIONs (that must be built manually)

# ----- create a filter

To add a filter to the SearchFilter-container use the following class-function:

   add_filter( $id, $type, $dbfield, $active = false, $config = null );

Each filter is identified with a numerical id in range 1..32. When used with
the Table-class, the identifiers of the filter must match with the respective
table-column-id.

Type $type is a string specifying which filter you want to use on your
SQL-field (see class-documentation in include/filters.php).

For example with the following instructions a numeric-Filter
is used. Values that are entered in the input-form-element are transformed
into a SQL-query, that restrict the SQL-field 'P.ID'. The $dbfield must
reference a valid SQL-field in the resulting main-query. Here, the resulting
query must contain a FROM-part with 'Players P' for example. Of course,
you can also write 'Players.ID' as $dbfield.

   $filter = new SearchFilter();
   $f1 =& $filter->add_filter( 1, 'Numeric', 'P.ID', true);

   $filter->init(); # parses form-values from URL: sf1=3-7
   # or:
   $f1->parse("3-7"); # filters can directly be initialized

   $f1->get_query() returns a QuerySQL-object with a WHERE-clause-part
   transformed by a parsed range-syntax:

      P.ID >= 3 AND P.ID <= 7

If no value entered in the input-elements for the filter, $filter->get_query()
returns NULL. However when using the SearchFilters-class to handle the filters
the query-parts of all added filters are merged automatically:

   $filter->has_query() can check, if there is a query
   $filter->get_query() returns a non-null QuerySQL-object.

# ----- specify SQL-queries with $dbfield argument

The underlying global query must be merged with the filter-restrictions.
For that purpose, the QuerySQL-class (see include/std_classes.php) has been
introduced. It allows to build (rather complex) SQL-queries by adding
separate SQL-parts or merging it with other query-parts. Not every possible
SQL-query can be created with this class, but the standard cases pose
no problem (use of AND, some simple ORs, JOINs). More complex queries
like using UNIONs are not supported yet.

When using filters, an existing global SQL-query must be written using
a QuerySQL-object. If your query is too complex to be built using the
QuerySQL-class, that step can also be done manually, but then you have
to do the merging with the filters by yourself.

However the $dbfield is not only restricted to simple SQL-fields.
You may only associate more complex queries with a filter.
This often occurs with static external forms, when a filter needs some
more tables to be joined into the main-query.

Example:
   You have a page showing entries from a table Table1 with some standard
   restriction. Additionally you want to restrict the query with
   a numeric-filter that needs to join with another table Table2, but only
   if there is some value specified for the filter.

   Your main query is

      SELECT T1.* FROM Table1 T1 WHERE T1.std > 2

   This must be written using a QuerySQL-object:

      $qsql = new QuerySQL(
         SQLP_FIELDS, 'T1.*',
         SQLP_FROM,   'Table1 T1',
         SQLP_WHERE,  'T1.std > 2' );

   Then the filters:

      $filter = new SearchFilter();
      $filter->add_filter( 1, 'Numeric',
         new QuerySQL( SQLP_FNAMES, 'T2.numval', SQLP_FROM, 'Table2 T2' ),
         true );
      $filter->init();

      ...
      $qsql->merge( $filter->get_query() );
      $query = $qsql->get_select();


The $active argument controls the activity-state of a filter. If a filter
is not active, then it's value does not contribute to a merged query.
An inactive filter used within a Table, is shown as hidden filters ('+')
and can be shown (activated) clicking on the '+'-symbol.

The $config argument to the add_filter-functions allows to specify additional
configuration to change the appearance of the filter-GUI or the behaviour
of the filter (available syntax for example, see class-documentation of
the filters).

# ----- examples

How to use the filters is best and easiest explained by example.
Besides the two examples-files, which can be opened in your browser
(see previous section for content):

   code_examples/filter_example.php   - Form / Table / Filters
   code_examples/filter_example2.php  - all filters-types and configs

you can also have a look into the various DGS-pages using filters:

   waiting_room.php      - Table + Filters
   show_games.php        - Table + Filters
   users.php             - Table + Filters, adding extra URL-varlink

   user_stats.php        - External Form + Table + Filters
   search_messages.php   - External Form + Table + Filters

   forum/search.php      - Only Form with Filters, show data only if query

For testing purposes all of those pages have a var $DEBUG_SQL (normally
commented out). If set to true, the resulting query is shown on the page.

# ----- page-links and form-elements

There is an inherent problem when combining links with form-elements.
Links can be prepared to contain the values the page was initially shown
with, but freshly changed values are lost if following the link. So it's
best to avoid to many links on pages when used together with related
form-elements. However, it's not always useful and not everything can
be done using form-elements alone.

Using filters with a Table needs some hints how to properly handle links.
A table with filters has form elements in the table-head and below the
table to control the table (start/reset-search, show-rows, add column).
It also has several links:

   1. the offset-links for paging (navigate within the resultset)
   2. the sort-links on the table-heads
   3. the delete-column-link beside the table-heads
   4. the hide- and show-links for the filters

   - links on the values in the table-rows

When you want to refresh the page using additional links (for example
at the bottom-page) and want to preserve the values of all the
form-elements, the URL of the links must contain these URL-encoded values.

Vice versa, when submitting the form to refresh the page, also the
current from-offset (1), the sort-fields and directions (2) must be
preserved using hidden-form-elements.

If correctly initialized, the filter-framework handles this automatically.
Take a look to code_examples/filter_example.php and the DGS-standard
pages referenced as example-pages above.

However, for page-links you may need to manually build the URL.
For this purpose, there are the following functions you can use to get
this kind of information ( $table is the Table-object ):

   $table->current_from_string()    - current page-offset (1)
   $table->current_sort_string()    - current sort-fields and directions (2)
   $table->current_filter_string()  - visible and managing filter-values
   $table->current_rows_string()    - current max-rows

The page "user_stats.php" is a good example for this.

Values for the filters are not only consist of the shown form-elements
but also of some filter-managing variables that need to be included too.


# ----- combining tables, filters and additional URL-vars

For the following combinations, see "code_examples/filter_example.php":

   - External-Form with Filters
   - External-Form with Filters + Table with Filters
   - Table with Filters


# Table + additional URL-var
Sometimes you want to have a page, that not only contains forms with or
without a Table and filters, but also can be controlled with some additional
variable passed via URL (e.g. show_games.php, users.php).

To correctly handling this URL passing it on when submitting a form, you
have to register it. It depends on what combination of table, form and
filters you are using.

Example (from users.php):
   The page is showing users in a Table with filters.
   If the URL-var 'observe=<gameID>' is set, the page shows the observers
   of the specified game-ID.

   # get URL-var
   $observe_gid = (int)get_request_arg('observe');

   # define table-filters
   $ufilter = new SearchFilter();
   $ufilter->add_filter( 1, 'Numeric', 'P.ID', true);
   ...
   $ufilter->init(); // parse current value from URL

   # define table + register filters
   $utable = new Table( 'user', $page, 'UsersColumns' );
   $utable->register_filter( $ufilter );
   $utable->add_or_del_column();

   # register additional URL-var
   if ( $observe_gid ) {
      $rp = new RequestParameters();
      $rp->add_entry( 'observe', $observe_gid );
      $utable->add_external_parameters( $rp, true );
   }

The 'true' is important in the last statement add_external_parameters().


# External-Form + Table + additional URL-var
But if you want to have a page also with an external-form, the registering
of additional URL-vars and the joining of the external-form with the table
is different to avoid that some vars are inserted twice within through the
hidden-elements.

For such a complex example using an external form, a table with filters and
additional URL-vars you may take a look at "user_stats.php".
The basic order of instructions in that case is:

   # get URL-vars
   $uid = get_request_arg( 'uid' );

   # define static filters (external form)
   $usfilter = new SearchFilter('s');
   $usfilter->add_filter( 1, 'Numeric', 'G.Size', true);
   $usfilter->init();

   # define table-filters
   $ufilter = new SearchFilter();
   $ufilter->add_filter( 1, 'Numeric', 'P.ID', true);
   $ufilter->init();

   # specify External-Form
   $usform = new Form( $utable->Prefix, $page, FORM_GET, false, 'formTable');
   $utable->set_externalform( $usform ); # also attach offset, sort, manage-filter as hidden (table) to ext-form
   $usform->attach_table( $usfilter );   # attach manage-filter as hiddens (static) to ext-form

   # URL-page-vars
   $page_vars = new RequestParameters();
   $page_vars->add_entry( 'uid', $uid );
   $usform->attach_table( $page_vars ); # for page-vars as hiddens in form


# ----- different filter-sets

The page "show_games.php" basically have three different views (observed,
finished, running games) and needed special handling for the filters.
That is because for some IDs (table-col-id) different SQL-fields are
used in the different views. Therefore also the filters need to have
different "views".

This is accomplished using three different SearchFilter-objects, one for
each view, but with different prefixes:

   # fprefix: o=observed-games, r=running-games, f=finished-games
   $gfilter = new SearchFilter( $fprefix );

Each filter has an ID. This number is used as suffix to build the form-
element-names. The standard prefix is 'sf' when the constructor of
SearchFilter() is used without an argument. So the value '20' for the
filter:

   $filter = new SearchFilter();
   $filter->add_filter( 1, 'Numeric', 'P.ID', true);

is transported in the URL-var 'sf1' (GET or POST-method).
When using a prefix like:

   $filter = new SearchFilter( 'f' );
   $filter->add_filter( 1, 'Numeric', 'P.ID', true);

the filter-value is transported in the URL-var 'fsf1'.
So by introducing a prefix in the page "show_games.php", also the
filters "live" in different namespaces concerning the values for
the filters in the different views.


The same trick is and should be used, when you have a static form
with filters combined with a table with filters. In the above example
in the previous subsection, two SearchFilters are defined:

   # define static filters (external form)
   $usfilter = new SearchFilter('s');
   ...

   # define table-filters
   $ufilter = new SearchFilter();

one with prefix and one without to have different namespaces.
With that mechanism you can also define more than 32 filters, though only
32 filters applied on a single table and its corresponding filters.

Be aware that there is an exception when using the filter-config FC_FNAME.
If you specify an alternative form-elements-name with this config, the prefix
is not applied.
With this feature it's possible to declare common filters shared among
different views. The other purpose of FC_FNAME was to allow to pass-in
a filter-value over URL without using a cryptic name like 'sf<ID>',
that could be subject to change, if the order of filter-IDs is changed
(for example, see the page "users.php" for the 'active'-filter).


#-------- (4) Development Guide -----------------------------------------------

This section gives some insights when you need to develop a new type of
filter, though it doesn't describe every detail. For that, you may take
a look into the sources.

Besides of thinking about adding a new filter, you may also want to add
a new filter-config, a new syntax for numeric- and text-based filters
(range-syntax, wildcard-syntax), a new quoting mechanism or enhancements
of the underlying framework or helping classes (like QuerySQL for example).
Except for adding new filters and new filter-configs, please consult
me (juga) first before changing the framework.

Before thinking about what filter to use or thinking about developing
a new filter, best practice is to follow the following steps.

   1. Before using a filter, take a minute to think, if it makes sense
      to provide that filter. Especially it shouldn't put too much workload
      on the server. So it would be good that the resulting filter-query
      can be optimized by the database using indexes; or at least the
      table-scans can be performed efficiently (for example only resulting
      in a few selected entries to be searched for).

   2. check, if the filter you are searching for, can't be built using
      the existing filters. Try to find a filter in the example-file
      "code_examples/filter_examples2.php" that matches your needs, even if
      not fully.

   3. If you found a filter that basically fulfills your needs, but not
      completly, check out the filters' class-documentation for additional
      configs that can be used to change the filters behaviour:
         see "include/filters.php", class Filter<Type>

   4. Read the FAQ-section (5) in this file. Maybe there's something in,
      that can fulfill your needs.

   5. If no filter does match your needs, maybe a combination of existing
      filters can fulfill the same purpose. If not directly, then maybe
      by adding a new filter indirectly using other Filter-classes.
      As example you may take a look at the classes: FilterRatingDiff,
      FilterRelativeDate. They extend and implicitly use other filters.

The first decision is, if you need more than one form-element for your filter
(multi-element-filter). That is influencing the interface, that needs to
be implemented.

To develop a new filter, take the following basic steps:

   1. Think of a type (name) for your filter.

   2. Copy one of the existing Filter-classes, e.g. FilterNumeric to your new
      filter-class 'Filter<type>' and adjust it to your needs.
      For a multi-element-filter, you may use the FilterScore-class to copy.
      It is preferred to add filters in "include/filters.php", so that isn't
      an absolute requirement. However, the SearchFilter-class must be able
      to find the new class, so during runtime, the file containing your new
      filter should be included once.

   3. Change the constructor:

      - provide optional default-config
      - set the type
      - check args and options if needed
      - set syntax-description
      - init internal vars if needed

   4. Implement the filter-interface-functions (declared as abstract in
      Filter-class):

      - parse_value( $name, $val )
      - build_query(), only for multi-element-filters
      - get_input_element($prefix, $attr = array() )

   5. adjust the class-documentation, scan all available FC_-configs,
      if they can be used with your filter and document them accordingly.

   6. add your new filter to "code_examples/filter_example2.php" with
      all special new options you defined.

   7. adjust this file to list your new filters in the sections:
      - (2) Classes and Files
      - (3) Users Guide
      - (5) FAQ
      - (7) Known Bugs (if any)


Changing one of the following classes is sensible work and shouldn't be done
without consultation; or you volunteer to write some unit-tests to assert
the correct functionality of existing parsers and framework after
your changes ;)

   - SearchFilter, Filter
   - BasicTokenizer, StringTokenizer
   - BasicParser, TextParser, NumericParser, DateParser
   - QuerySQL, RequestParameters


#-------- (5) FAQ -------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains some questions regarding the usage of filters for
developers of DGS. When reffering to "see examples", the example-files
"code_examples/filter_example.php" and "code_examples/filter_example.php2"
are meant. More documentation you will also find in the sources,
see section (2) Classes and Files.

* What filter can be used to search for negative numeric values ?

  Not directly possible at the moment when you still want to use the
  range-syntax. The Numeric-Filter does not allow this, because the
  minus '-' is used as special range-char.
  But you can still enter a negative-value by quoting the '-'-char
  of course.

  However, if you forbid range-syntax using filter-config FC_NO_RANGE,
  then the '-' is treated as minus-sign. But that also allows to specify
  exact values for that filter.

* Can I use numeric double-values ?

  Yes. Use Numeric-Filter: a double 7.5 is also considered a numeric.

* Can I use SQL-queries using the OR-operator ?

  Yes, but it depends on the resulting query. Take a look on the
  example-files searching for FC_SQL_TEMPLATE and FC_GROUP_SQL_OR and
  take a look in "include/filters.php" at the documentation for those
  filter-configs (where the constants are defined).

  If those filter-configs are not sufficient, you may use a complex
  query using the QuerySQL-class. For that check out the examples too.

  If all those possibilities doesn't fit your needs, you have to build
  the query manually.

* How can the size or maximum length of the text-input-elements be changed ?

  This is filter-specific, but normally can be changed with the
  filter-config FC_SIZE and FC_MAXLEN. Read the according documentation
  of the according Filter-class.

* Can I allow a text to start with a wildcard ?

  Yes. See filter-config FC_START_WILD and see example-files for
  the possible values for this config.

* Can I search for a substring without explicit use of a leading and
  trailing wildcard ?

  Yes. See filter-config FC_SUBSTRING.
  Using this config implicitly forbids range-syntax.
  Needs filter-config FC_START_WILD to be set.
  Example on Text-Filter #6 in "code_examples/filter_example2.php".

* Can I forbid wildcards to be used ?

  Yes. See filter-config FC_NO_WILD.
  The wildcard-char '*' then is treated as normal character.

* Can I forbid the range-syntax to be used ?

  Yes. See filter-config FC_NO_RANGE.
  The range-char '-' then is treated as normal character.

* How can I build a complex query, but still using the filter-framework
  to input values for a filter ?

  Use filter-config FC_SQL_SKIP. See also example-files and check out
  the possibilities you have with QuerySQL (see "include/std_classes.php"
  and "code_examples/query_sql.php").

  With FC_SQL_SKIP the particular filter-query isn't merged in the
  SearchFilter-class and you must handle the merge manually:

    $qsql = $searchfilter->get_query();
    $f =& $searchfilter->get_filter(id);
    if ( $f->has_query() ) {
       $fq = $f->get_query();
       $where = $fq->get_part( SQLP_WHERE ); ...
    }

* Can I add a SQL-part using the HAVING-clause instead of the WHERE-clause ?

  Yes. See filter-config FC_ADD_HAVING and/or use the QuerySQL-class.
  See also example-files.

* Can I provide default-values to filters without specifying it in the URL ?

  Yes. See filter-config FC_DEFAULT and see the big defaults-example in
  the example-files. Be aware that this config is filter-specific, so take
  also a close look on the filter-specific documentation. Escpecially for
  the multi-element-filters this is important.
  The "Reset search" will reset the filters to that defaults.

* How can I use numeric-values on the SQL-fields that differ from the
  entered value by some factor ?

  Use Numeric-Filter with filter-config FC_NUM_FACTOR. See example-files.

* Can I change the (default) used quoting-type used for text- and numeric-
  based filters ?

  Yes. See filter-config FC_QUOTETYPE and in example-files.
  Though this is not recommended. The config was merely added to allow
  for some tests of the quoting-mechanisms.

* Can I make the filters static when used with a Table, so that they
  are always shown and can't be hidden ?

  Yes. See filter-config FC_STATIC and in example-file
  "code_examples/filter_example.php".

  Actually it's the default now to show all filter-elements as static,
  which can be controlled with the global const FILTER_CONF_FORCE_STATIC.
  This can be overruled using the filter-config FC_HIDE,
  see "code_examples/filter_example.php".

* Can I use multiple-select elements for filters ?

  Yes. There are some predefined filters allowing to select more
  than one element. See FilterSelection, FilterCheckboxArray.
  Also see example-files. This must be activated filter-specific
  using the filter-config FC_MULTIPLE. See the filter-class-documentation.

* How can I set filter-values via URL-vars ?

  There are two ways how to accomplish this:
  Beware that a "Reset Search" may clear those values, if not defined
  with FC_DEFAULT-config.

  1. Directly use the filters form-element-name to specify the value.
     It's recommended to use the filter-config FC_FNAME for this.
     That name is absolute and not changed even if several SearchFilter-
     objects are used with prefixes. See also section (4) Developement Guide.

  2. Do your own parsing of the URL-var, and after the filter-init() call,
     parse the value into the filters:

        $parsed_value = get_request_arg( 'myvar' );

        $filter = new SearchFilter();
        $f1 =& $filter->add_filter( 1, 'Numeric', 'P.ID', true);
        $filter->init(); # parse URL-vars
        $f1->parse_value( $parsed_value );

* Can I use filters that depend on the values in other filters ?

  Yes. See filter-config FC_IF and see example-files.

* Can I use a filter for searching on table-columns with values 'Y|N' ?

  Yes. Use BoolSelect-Filter and see example-files.
  For the Rated-column in the Games-table there is also the special
  RatedSelect-Filter also taking the 'Done'-value into account.

* Must I escape the '-40%' for a rank when using Rating-Filter ?

  No. The minus-sign '-' is treated in a special way and need not to be
  escaped while still allowing to use range-syntax.
  However you may do escape it: "7k (-20%)" and "7k (\-20%)" are equivalent.

* Can I extend the default syntax-hover-text-description of a filter ?

  Yes. See filter-config FC_SYNTAX_HINT.
  Example on Numeric-Filter #2 in "code_examples/filter_example2.php".

* Can I use checkboxes to build a bitmask to search for ?

  Yes. See filter-config FC_BITMASK.
  Example on CheckboxArray-Filter #3 in "code_examples/filter_example2.php".


#-------- (6) Possible Future Enhancements ------------------------------------
# Priority (1=high, 5=low, ?=unknown) is added, e.g. Prio(1)

This section outlines some ideas that came to my (juga) mind regarding the
filters, but are not necessarily going to be implemented. Just wanted to
write them down somewhere.


* Prio(1): Save filter-specific settings for user:
  - Prio(1): visibility-state (like column-visibility)
  - Prio(?): quote-type, quote-chars, range-sep, wildcard-char, range-sep-str{2}, relrange-str{2}
  - Prio(?): FCONF_ShowToggleFilter/FilterTableHead

* Prio(?): new basic filter-syntax allowing to search for list of values
  (if implemented need to be supported by StringTokenizer-class to be used
  for numeric- and text-based filters):
  - possible syntax: "val1, val2" use ',' as separator of values;
    or more general provide list-separating-char(s) with filter-config:
    FC_LISTSEP = ' ,;' for example
  - corresponding SQL: field IN (val1, val2, ...)
  - list-syntax mutually exclusive to range-syntax or wildcard-syntax

* Prio(?): add support for UNION-SQL-syntax in QuerySQL-class to be able to
  optimize queries (instead of using OR)

* Prio(?): Perform global checks on Filters before building query to be able
  to avoid costly queries. Possible global restrictions could be:
  - minimum set of used filter-values in fields (to be able to optimize search)

* Prio(?): new filter-config for text-based filters:
  - FC_IMPLICIT_WILDCARD: 0(default) | 1
  - filter on 'abc' -> would implicitly search for 'abc*'

* Prio(?): including additional help-reference to Help or FAQ-page
  - maybe using new filter-config FC_HELP => faq_label
  - could show up as '?' near input-element

* Prio(?): LINK_VALUE-feature for Tables with Filters:
  An additional submit-button 'Link Navigation' could switch the displayed
  values in a table to be equipped with links (or an additional link)
  that would restrict the corresponding table-column to exactly that value
  (use the clicked value as new value for a designated filter).
  For example, the Games Handicap-column shows value '3'. Clicking on the
  additional link would restrict the filter on the handicap-column to use
  the '3' as new value.

  Cool feature to quickly restrict a search to what you want, but may need
  some deep changes:
  - get rid of <TD> in table-rows or use a parser to add additional link-code
  - could be a table-feature, adding the <td> by Table-class (but then
    need way to specify attributes to <td>)
  - could be configured only for selected filters -> FC_LINK_VALUE-config


#-------- (7) Known Bugs ------------------------------------------------------
# Priority (1=high, 3=low, E=enhancement/feature) is added, e.g. Prio(1)

The listed problems in this section doesn't disturb the basic functioning
of the filter-framework, but are identified as bugs, though some could also
be considered a feature ;)


* Prio(E): Using Table with Filters: if user selects a new max-rows or select
  a new column to add to table, also the "Start/Reset Search" submit-button
  executes the according action (change max-rows or add-column).
  => the submit-buttons should only carry out "their" action

* Prio(E): If used without external-form, the submit-buttons "Start Search"
  and "Reset Search" may disappear, when no filter is active and is shown in
  Table-head.
