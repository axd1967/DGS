#-------- (1) Introduction ----------------------------------------------------

Voting on a "survey" can be used to collect opinions or make a public decision
by majority about a certain topic. The eligible users can select from given
choices shown as survey-options with an optional descriptive text.

There are four survey-types:

   Points   = survey-options with selection of points within certain range,
              using selectbox-choices with points

   Sum      = sum of points-selection of survey-options must be within configured point-range,
              using selectbox-choices with points checked against a total-points-sum

   Single   = choose only one of many survey-options,
              single-choice using radio-buttons,
              value of options can serve to give different weight,

   Multi    = multiple choice of survey-options,
              multiple-choice using checkboxes,
              value of options can serve to give different weight

Typical use-cases:

   * Vote on certain aspect of a feature,
     e.g. "Feature ABC" -> (A) keep it as it is, (B) change it

   * Vote on user-preference about something,
     e.g. "Favourite color for XYZ?" -> (A) red, (B) blue

   * Tournament-adjudication for games that are "decided", but not ended blocking proceedings,
     e.g. "Adjudication about game 123: expected result?" assigned for vote by adjudicators
     -> (A) White win, (B) Black wins, (C) Jigo, (D) No result, (E) Game should continue

Restrictions:
   * Voting on surveys only allowed to users with 2 finished games and
     actively playing in a game within the last 30 days
   * Surveys can be created and managed by a survey-admin
   * Survey-functionality can be disabled for DGS with ALLOW_SURVEY_VOTE in server-config


#-------- (2) Users Guide -----------------------------------------------------

#-------- (2a) Manage Survey --------------------------------------------------

Described Use-cases:
   - Create new survey (type, status, min/max-points/selections, title, options, userlist)
   - Edit survey
     - Change survey-status
     - Change survey (title, header, options with text)
   - Fix consistency of survey-data

* Create new survey:

  1. Select "Admin survey" on the "admin"-page, or
     Select "New survey" on the survey-list-page

  2. Specify survey-settings:

     * survey-type and min/max points/selection (depending on survey-type):
       see field 'Type' of db-table 'Survey' in "specs/db/table-Voting.txt"

     * survey-status:
       see field 'Status' of db-table 'Survey' in "specs/db/table-Voting.txt"
       - NEW = survey in creation-mode, can not be voted on
       - ACTIVE = survey can be voted on, but other fields can not be changed any more
       - CLOSED = survey can not be voted on any more, voting-results are shown
       - DELETE = survey is hidden, ready to be deleted

     * survey-title: mandatory title of survey

     * survey-options:
       - survey can have optional survey-header-text between title and survey-options
       - max. 26 survey-options per survey allowed (restricted by labels 'A-Z')
       - each survey-option can have an optional description shown below it
       - enter at least two survey-options with fields dependent on survey-type

       - syntax for survey-option:

            <opt tag [min_points] "title">description

               - tag = 1..n, unique label/option-number
               - min_points = point of option adding to score if selected by user-vote,
                 can be optional, depends on survey-type, has defaults if needed (almost always 1)
               - title = title of survey-option
               - description = optional text describing option

               - order of options defined by order of <opt>-tags (not by tag)

         Example for MULTI-type:

            Choose wisely!            -- header-text
            <opt 1 5 "Dog"> woof
            <opt 2 3 "Cat"> meow
            <opt 3 -2 "Goat"> baa

     * survey-userlist (optional):
       list of user-id (Players.Handle) to restrict voting to a group of users,
       survey can be viewed by public but only listed users can vote upon it

   3. Preview: to check for errors

   4. Save Survey: to create survey if check revealed no errors

   * Additional Infos:
      - Surveys (except on status DELETE) are listed on survey-list-page
      - All surveys can be publically viewed, but may not be advertisted to the public,
        though they are listed in the survey-list-page. For example for tournament-decisions
        between tournament-directors.

* Edit survey:

  1. Select "Surveys" on "site-map" or "Forums"-page

  2. For survey-admins an admin edit-link is shown in the survey-list

  3a. Change survey-status,
  3b. Change survey (title, header, options with text):

     - can be changed any time
     - other fields can only be changed on NEW-status,
     - other fields can normally NOT be changed on ACTIVE-status,
       except if nobody started to vote on it.
       If there is at least one vote, the content of the survey can not be changed,
       because it could change the "opinion" of the voter.

       In this case, better create a new survey or delete all votes (new feature needed).
       So ensure, that all texts and options are cleaned up before ACTIVating a survey.

* Fix consistency of survey-data:

   - only for database-admin

   - There's an admin-script "scripts/voting_consistency.php"
     to fix consistency of (feature- and) survey-data, see also "scripts/index.php"
     - fix Survey.UserCount & SurveyOption.Score

#-------- (3) Design, Classes and Files ---------------------------------------
